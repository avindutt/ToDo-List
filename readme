1. At very first I created the server by requiring Express (npm install express) and Port.
After that I installed the package installer into it by npm init. 
Finally making the port listen to the app and hence running the server by localhost.

2. Set the template engine (EJS) by npm install ejs for creating html pages under views.
Created a views folder.
Set the path for this 'views' folder to be followed. [ app.set('views', './views'); ]
Created html page within view folder (home.ejs) and rendered it through res.render(home);

3. Created a middleware (app.use(express.urlencoded)) so that it reads the request and transform it into keys and value pairs and then forwards the request to the controller function.

4. Declared an array of mainList containing keys values and adding it as a key value pair in the main controller function. This will render the mainList key-value pairs at the html page.

5. Created a post method to fetch the data coming from the form from home.ejs
Now the mainList containing todo tasks has been rendered on the html page.

6. I needed to create a delete function also for deleting tasks from the list.
For that I used Query and Params. Query are of format '/?something=' whereas Params are of format '/:something'. Query can be chained as well using '&' symbol.
In the form containing the delete button I put the url containing param and directed it to the router(containing param) with get request and displayed the param request on console. This param then was taken into a variable and then ultimately I created a splice function to remove the task from the list.

7.Finally we have to connect our app to the database for which we will use MongoDB.
First I start with creating schemas. (Schema defines what fields should be there in the document such as Description, Category in our ToDo List)
